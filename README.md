# Pokedex
This is a basic SQL database that creates a barebones PokeDex to give an example of its functionality. 
When one is looking in the PokeDex, they will be able to identify pokemon based on their type and ID number and be able to make querys based on that. 


Any and all mentions of usernames or passwords to access a database has been removed and replaced with a '...' in order to see how the website would function, there is a video to demonstrate its functionality. 



This project was created as a project at Seattle University and is completed as of December 3rd, 2021.
This project was worked and completed by Ethan Tarlov and Braedon Gipson.
There will also be a video to demonstrate how the website works to give a better understanding of its functionality.
